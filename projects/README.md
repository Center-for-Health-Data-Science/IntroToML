# Projects

We will create 6 groups (4-5 people)
* Each group selects a data set and discuss a project
* The goal of the project is to do machine learning on some real data
* You can use your own data, but the focus needs to be on pytorch -- not on data manipulation

## Data and project ideas:
* Project on gene expression from cancer and healthy tissue [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/Center-for-Health-Data-Science/IntroToML/blob/HEAD/projects/gtex_and_tcga.ipynb)
* The DNA data from human promoters used in the last exercise on Day 2. In promoters.md there are some project ideas.
