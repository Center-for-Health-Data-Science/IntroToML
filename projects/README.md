# Projects

We will create 6 groups (4-5 people)
* Each group selects a data set and discuss a project
* The goal of the project is to do machine learning on some real data
* You can use your own data, but the focus needs to be on pytorch -- not on data manipulation

## Data and project ideas:
* Gene expression data (IntroToML/data/gtex_with_cancer.csv.gz)
* Metagenomic kmers (“IntroToML/data/kmers*”) with some project guidelines under (“IntroToML/projects/kmers.md”) 
* Another metagenomics set from the paper "Altered gut microbial profile is associated with abnormal metabolism activity of Autism Spectrum Disorder" with a complete tutorial to follow: https://www.kaggle.com/remyz5/prediction-with-4-models
* The DNA data from human promoters used in the last exercise on Day 2
