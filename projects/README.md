# Projects

We will create 6 groups (4-5 people)
* Each group selects a data set and discuss a project
* The goal of the project is to do machine learning on some real data
* You can use your own data, but the focus needs to be on pytorch -- not on data manipulation

## Data and project ideas:
* Gene expression data (IntroToML/data/gtex_with_cancer.csv.gz)
* The DNA data from human promoters used in the last exercise on Day 2. In promoters.md there are some project ideas.
