# Day 1: Introduction to ML
Today will consist of three major parts. 

## Introduction to ML
Here we will learn what ML methods consist of - how they can be used, and we will get introducted to working with google colab and python notebooks. We will use a notebook to get introduced to some of the packages, and just looking at data and plotting in python.

## Unsupervised learning - PCA
We will learn one particular method for unsupervised learning - PCA, and apply it to a gene expression dataset. [PCA.ipynb](PCA.ipynb)[![Open in Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1gC99sg3WnZ9mwrOaAkERnQ7g5m9MnXNR?usp=sharing)

## Supervised learning - logistic regression
We will learn about supervised learning with the help of logistic regression on some voting data, and if time permits, we will explore together some other methods and other datasets.
